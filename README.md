- Else and Finally clauses
- Raising exceptions
- Multiple exception handling

### 8. Modules and Libraries
- What are modules, packages, and libraries
- Importing modules
- Popular libraries (math, pandas, gradio, emoji)

### 9. Automation Projects
- **Log File Health Monitoring System**: Analyze server logs and determine system health
- **Resume Eligibility Analyzer**: Evaluate candidate resumes based on skills
- **Student Examination Eligibility System**: Process attendance records

### 10. Interactive Applications
- **Gradio**-based interfaces for:

  - File upload and analysis tools

## 🛠️ Practical Exercises

The notebook includes several hands-on exercises:
1. File sorting based on extensions
2. Washing machine fuzzy logic simulation
3. Employee performance rating system
4. Fuel efficiency indicator
5. Smart salary processing
6. Electricity billing automation
7. First digit extraction
8. Hospital OPD queue management
9. Text cleaning and word processing

## 📦 Dependencies

```bash
pip install gradio pandas emoji
```

### 📊 Sample Applications
##### 1. Log File Health Monitor
Upload server log files to analyze ERROR frequency and determine system status (CRITICAL, WARNING, NORMAL).

#### 2. Resume Analyzer
Upload resume text files to count skills and determine candidate eligibility (REJECTED, NOT ELIGIBLE, ELIGIBLE, HIGHLY ELIGIBLE).
